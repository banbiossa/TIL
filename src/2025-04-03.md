## next.js is cool
- all the Forward Deploy Engineer (FDE) positions require next.js
- i did a few tutorials
  - blog
  - dashboard
- it's really cool, hits the right balance between
  - configured (react-ness)
  - auth middleware (enough to be dangerous)
  - backend/ORM support with prisma
- I feel pretty frontend-dev ish now...
