- when finding a value you typically do binary search
- when closing a range golden ratio search comes handy
  - consider [0, 0.38, 0.62, 1]
  - the next range is [0, 0.23, 0.38, 0.62], 0.38 is computed in the previous step
  - a : b = (a + b): a  (where b=1, a=1.618) is the idea
  - use fibonacci numbers to get ints for the results
