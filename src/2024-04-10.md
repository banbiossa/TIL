# convolution
- you can do convolution in O(NlogN)
  - d[k] = sum (x[i]+y[j]) where i+j == k
- i'm quite sure there's no straightforward python implementation
  - numpy does it in O(N^2)
  - scipy does it in O(NlogN) but in floats
- ChatGPT will provide a well working (int, mods) code
  - the mod needs to be in form of 2**km+1 so 998244353 is a giveaway
